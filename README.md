## Corth
It's like Forth but in C. But I don't actually know since I never programmed in Forth, I only heard that it's some sort of stack-based programming language. Corth is also stack-based programming language. which makes it just like Forth am I rite?

### Quick Start

```console
$ gcc corth.c -o corth -Wall -Wextra
$ ./corth sim ./test.corth
$ ./corth com ./test.corth
$ ./test.corth.out
```
